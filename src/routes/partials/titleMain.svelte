    <p class="info-description">
      From a young age, I was captivated by the sheer magic of computers, 
      and today, as a software developer, my objective is to make that magic
      a reality. I started my journey in the coding world when I was in junior 
      high, and by high school, I was more interested in coding than listening 
      to my professors during class. Throughout my career, I've always 
      recognized the importance of teamwork, and I believe that it takes a 
      collective effort to develop truly great projects. I enjoy finding the 
      unique skills of each teammate and leveraging them to create innovative 
      software solutions. I am committed to creating innovative tools that can 
      have a significant impact on industries like aerospace and finance. With a 
      deep appreciation for the power of technology and a commitment to 
      collaboration, I'm excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities 
      that the world of software development has to offer.
